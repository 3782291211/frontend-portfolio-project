# **Northcoders News**: a front end *React* project

**[Link to my live web app](
nc-news-react-app.netlify.app)**

**Northcoders News** is an online social hub where you can view and post articles and comments. Articles fall under different topics and each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted. Users can also view and add comments on any article.

The website is linked to a RESTful back end API I made using node and express, which exposes a wide variety of endpoints to the web app and covers the full range of CRUD operations. The user interface allows for lots of interactivity and offers a rich user experience, through extensive use of conditional rendering, meaningful user interface updates, impactful error handling, appropriate feedback regarding loading states and confirmation of successful submissions.

At every stage of this project, the design and styling process was heavily based on responsive design, ensuring that the website caters to all available viewport widths from smaller smartphones to tablets and desktop.
